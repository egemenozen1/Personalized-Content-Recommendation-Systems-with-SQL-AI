# SQL and AI-Driven Personalized Content Recommendation Systems for Small Businesses and Streaming Services

## Overview
This repository contains Egemen Özen's master's thesis, *"Using SQL and AI for Personalized Content Recommendations in Streaming Services"*. The thesis delves into the development and adaptation of personalized recommendation systems leveraging SQL databases and AI algorithms. The aim is to bridge the gap between large-scale systems used by giants like Netflix and Amazon Prime, and their implementation for small-scale e-commerce businesses, using real-world case studies.

## Abstract
The thesis provides an extensive examination of how personalized recommendation systems can be optimized for different scales, emphasizing data management and performance aspects. Key contributions include a comparative analysis of recommendation algorithms, an in-depth study of the role of SQL databases in data handling, and a focus on ethical considerations such as algorithmic bias, transparency, and data privacy. Real-world scenarios involving streaming services and small businesses illustrate how scalable recommendation engines can transform customer engagement and satisfaction.

## Contents
- **Thesis Document**: `Dissertation_EgemenOzen_Q1057283.pdf`
- **Chapters Include**:
  - Literature Review of Recommendation Systems
  - AI Techniques for Content Personalization
  - Comparative Analysis of SQL vs. NoSQL Databases
  - Case Studies: Netflix, Amazon Prime, and Small Business Implementation
  - Ethical Considerations in AI-Driven Recommendations
  - Methodologies and Results from Case Studies

## Objectives
1. **Adaptation of Recommendation Algorithms**: Explore methodologies to scale down recommendation systems for small businesses.
2. **SQL's Role in Data Management**: Analyze SQL database performance in handling customer and content data for recommendations.
3. **Ethical AI**: Address ethical issues such as data privacy, bias, and transparency in AI-driven recommendation systems.
4. **Practical Case Studies**: Draw lessons from industry leaders and translate them to small-scale e-commerce use cases.

## Methodology
The research adopts a mixed-methods approach:
- **Literature Review**: A comprehensive overview of the evolution of recommendation algorithms.
- **Primary Data Analysis**: Real-world case study analysis using data from a small bakery business and comparisons with Netflix and Amazon Prime.
- **SQL and AI Techniques**: Demonstrates practical SQL-based data management and AI-based recommendations.
- **Ethical Considerations**: A dedicated analysis on data privacy, algorithmic fairness, and transparency.

## Key Findings
- Small-scale businesses can leverage hybrid recommendation systems to improve customer engagement and sales.
- SQL databases provide robust capabilities for structured data management, but a hybrid approach with NoSQL offers superior flexibility for dynamic data.
- Ethical considerations such as transparency, fairness, and user privacy must be integral to the design of recommendation systems.

## Technologies and Tools Used
- **SQL Databases** (MySQL, PostgreSQL)
- **Python** (Pandas, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow)
- **Machine Learning Models**: Collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, hybrid methods, deep learning approaches.
- **Data Visualization**: Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Real-World Case Studies**: Netflix, Amazon Prime, and a local bakery dataset.

## Key Challenges and Ethical Considerations
- **Algorithmic Bias**: Ensuring fair recommendations without perpetuating biases inherent in training data.
- **Data Privacy**: Complying with GDPR and other regulations.
- **Model Interpretability**: Addressing the "black box" nature of AI models with tools such as LIME and SHAP.
- **Scalability**: Adapting models designed for large-scale data to smaller datasets.
